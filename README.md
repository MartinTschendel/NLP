# NLP

Realizing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. This repository is based on the Udemy course Machine Learning A-Z.<br>
Here I created a Bag of Words Model and trained different classifiers to predict if a review is positive or negative.<br>
I used several metrics to assess the performance of the classifiers. Results are exported to a csv.
* Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv
* 210104_BagOfWords.ipynb (classifiers: naive bayes and random forest)
* 210107-SingleReview-Prediction.ipynb (making predicitions on a single review with a random forest classifier)
* 210107-ModelSelection.ipynb (assessing the performance of 7 different classifiers. The results are saved within a dataframe and exported to a csv)
* 210117-ModelSelection.ipynb (assessing the performance of 8 different classifiers (including one artificial network, generated with tensorflow (ANN)). The results are saved within a dataframe and exported to a csv)
