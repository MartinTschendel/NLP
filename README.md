# NLP

Realizing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. This repository is based on the Udemy course Machine Learning A-Z.<br>
Here I created a Bag of Words Model and trained different classifiers to predict if a review is positive or negative.<br>
* Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv
* 210104_BagOfWords.ipynb (classifiers: naive bayes and random forest)
* 210107-SingleReview-Prediction.ipynb (making predicitions on a single review with a random forest classifier)
